Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Angela, web and mobile app developer and I enjoy coding with React, React Native, Expo, Firebase, Node and Express.

### How I like my code
I'm passionate about code quality. Details matter. This is why I prefer writing code that is
- Clean (no semicolons, no spaghetti code)
- KISS (Keep it stupid simple) and DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
- Atomic & Reusable
- I'm a big advocate of Design being not "just drawings" but the way we organize information. Good design is key to success and hence a good code base should closely follow good design.
- Storybook 
- Well tested

I believe that these contribute to stronger and faster development and a strong dev culture.
