### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Angela! I'm a web and mobile app developer specializing in React, React Native, Expo, Firebase, Node and Express. 

On my free time I like playing ping pong and I even made an app about it! [PingPongBuddies](https://ppb-firebase-hosting.web.app/) 

Some of my other favourite projects include 

The app for expats [Buddies](https://buddies-app.com/)
