### How I like my code
I'm passionate about code quality. Details matter. This is why I prefer writing code that is
- Minimal (no semicolons)
- Clean (no spaghetti code)
- KISS (Keep it stupid simple) and DRY (Do not repeat yourself)
- Atomic & Reusable
- Well tested
- I'm a big advocate of Design being not "just drawings" but the way we organize information. Good design is key to success and hence a good code base should closely follow good design.
- Demonstrated in Storybook  

I believe that these contribute to stronger and faster development and a strong dev culture.
